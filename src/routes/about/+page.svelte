        Hello there, my name is Sam and I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for front end
        development. I've been learning web development since 2013 where things looked a lot
        different than they do today. I aspire to always work with something that brings me joy and
        have a hand in making a better web experience through beautiful software and engaging web
        experiences. My other passions are playing video or board games, listening to audio books,
        cycling, playing and going on hikes with my dog, and traveling to some of the most beautiful
        places on earth.
